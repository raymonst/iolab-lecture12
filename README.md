==============

In this lab, you have one main task: 
* The homepage, which is designed for mobile, isn't responsive. Using the key concepts discussed in class, modify the html page and css styles so the page looks good on bigger screens. For this exercise, you only have to worry about creating an additional version (desktop)--don't worry about the tablet/middle-sized screen. 

If you're done with #1, continue with the second task:
* Modify the javascript file so that the navigation becomes "sticky", i.e. it stays on top of the page when the user scrolls down the page.

* This example assumes that we're starting with the desktop version and defining the alternative mobile styles using media queries. Our exercise is the opposite, since it's "mobile first".
